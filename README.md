# multithreading-merge-sort
Multithreading implementation of merge sort algorithm. Program splits merge sort algorithm iterations into available threads to speed up sorting process. 

Example result:
```
Array size: 10000000
Available threads: 4

Sorting time using 4 threads: 529 ms
Sorting time using single thread: 1489 ms

Was multi-threading sorting done correctly?: true
Was single-threading sorting done correctly?: true
```
